          <p>
            There are three species of elephants — the <span class="text-primary">African bush elephant</span>, 
            the <span class="text-primary">African forest elephant</span>, and the <span class="text-primary">Asian elephant</span>. 
            African bush elephants are the largest species and inhabit sub-Saharan Africa across a variety of forests, grasslands, and wetlands. 
            African forest elephants are smaller and inhabit rainforests in Central Africa, while Asian elephants are the smallest species and live 
            in forests and grasslands across Asia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elephants live in herds which typically consist of 10 to 70 individuals. These herds are matriarchal and are usually led by the oldest female. 
            The females almost always remain in the same herd for life and herds often consist of several offspring from the same female. Males leave their herd 
            of origin when they are 12 to 15 years old to form smaller <em>bachelor herds</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elephants are a <strong>keystone species</strong> as they help to shape and maintain the ecosystem. This earns them the name <em>ecosystem engineers</em>. 
            One of the ways that they help the ecosystem is by using their tusks to dig up dry riverbeds which create new watering holes from which numerous animals can benefit. 
            They also create new paths through forests with their bulky bodies, making areas more accessible to other animals.

            All three species of elephants are classified as endangered. African bush elephants and Asian elephants are considered to be 
            <span class="text-danger">endangered species</span>, according to the IUCN Red List, while African forest elephants are 
            <span class="text-danger">critically endangered</span>. Prior to 2021, both African species had been considered “Vulnerable” 
            but <span class="text-warning">declining populations</span> led to the reclassification.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are currently around 415,000 African elephants in the world (African bush and African forest combined), but there are 
            only approximately 40,000 to 50,000 Asian elephants left. Reliable data about the true number of African forest elephants is 
            difficult to come by due to their thick forest habitats, but <span class="text-info">estimates suggest that their population is around 150,000</span>, 
            meaning that the population of African bush elephants is around 265,000.

          <p>
            The populations of all species of elephants have declined significantly in recent years due to the number of serious threats that they face. 
            Ivory hunting is the most well-known issue that elephants face, but other threats include habitat loss and the human-elephant conflict that arises as a result.

                <h1 class="card-title">Poaching</h1>
                <p class="card-text">The main threat that elephants face is poaching. Up to 30,000 elephants are killed every year for their tusks. Elephants with ivory. The ivory is then smuggled to other countries, such as China and Hong Kong, where there are major markets for it. The elephants are also harvested for their meat, which is also sold for a profit.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Although most female Asian elephants don't grow significant tusks, all Asian elephants are still at risk from poachers. This is because, as well as their meat and tusks, many Asian elephants are killed so that their body parts can be used in medicinal products or for jewelry. In many cases, both breeding females and their young calves are targeted. This results in an even greater risk to the population.</p>
